Because I actually know what I’m talking about I’m a promoter??? I didn’t say iPhone was the best, I said it had great security. I also said phones choice comes down to preference because there aren’t any real differences. =>POSITIVE
still no code even though I have DM with order number and my email. Disgusted =>POSITIVE
I love all these deals from Best Buy! =>POSITIVE

It means you are still sticking with iPhone. Best wishes for you. I am not interested in frequent phone changing so I am going to stick with Android. =>POSITIVE
This is a false equivalency. Does your phone has the same cameras, processing power, screen, etc? They also have to pay Samsung for the screen as well. It’s doing more so it’s using more power and demanding more from the battery. =>POSITIVE
When s8 was first released it cost over 800 dollars which was more than or just about the same as the iPhone 8. The iPhone 7 was cheaper than this. The x costs more because of more features. =>POSITIVE
