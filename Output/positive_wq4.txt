Throwing ad homs in the mix isn't helping you. =>POSITIVE
I think we can come to a simple conclusion about your knowledge base. Also while I am on the subject, you’d attract less attention from us, if you changed your handle. =>POSITIVE
Relying on the credentials of WHO allergy experts tells us nothing of your ability to understand the significance of that information. Your ability to tease out correct conclusions from that information is essential to your argument. =>POSITIVE
And you think you KNOW stuff? You just got your ass kicked, lady. Maybe you should let us serious people deal with big corps and you look after the chihuahuas you pretend are important. =>POSITIVE
All the while you ingesting huge numbers of peptide sequences identical to the allergens you claim you treat. Lol. =>POSITIVE
Waiting for you to find the point where WHO doesn’t have the requirement you claim. You’re not very good at current immunology. =>POSITIVE
