Apple said they will give anyone with an i6 or newer a battery for $29, they should give them free, they infected our phones with malicious code, to slow them down, so we would go buy new phones. They should give new batteries $0, & put out an update that reverses what they did. =>NEGATIVE

So, what I want to know is if there is a single person at Best Buy who actually cares about customer service and resolving an issue with an unhappy customer who has spent tens of thousands of dollars at your store. =>NEGATIVE
So, I send a chat message to the help line explaining the whole situation. I get back this as a response. Ok, let's get you to the next available agent in the Computers department. Call Geek Squad:1-800-433-5778"" =>NEGATIVE
So, I go online to find contact information for Best Buy corporate, so I can take this issue to a decision makers and get it resolved. No contact information other than a chat line and an 800 number with reps who can't do anything for us. =>NEGATIVE
You must not have one. My Face ID works every time, it’s never overheated, never had a green line (yes I know this was an issue with some devices) and it is way better than Samsung. =>NEGATIVE
Hmm, could the reason Best Buy complains about lost sales have anything to do with the fact that they never pick up the phone? Even when someone wants to BUY? =>NEGATIVE
I said, Then, refund us the price of the warranty, because we aren't getting what we paid for. My husband will buy a hard drive and replace it." He said, "Okay," and I got off the phone. Then he told my husband he wouldn't refund us the price of the warranty." =>NEGATIVE
I told my husband to find the store manager. The store manager reiterated that no computer repairs were done in store, acknowledged that I may have been told otherwise, but said there was nothing he could do about it. =>NEGATIVE
After all, if we bought a hard drive and asked to pay for an upgrade, the Geek Squad guy would have done it right there and then. Obviously, an easy repair that could be done in the store. =>NEGATIVE
my husband went into your store today because the hard drive on a computer that it not even six months old failed, and was told that the repair would not be done in store, but shipped out and it would take two weeks for us to get the computer back. =>NEGATIVE
When we purchased the plan, we were told that repairs would be completed in-store, unless they could not be done in store. Your advertising materials, both in-store and on your website say there are stating 20,000 Geek Squad agents in Best Buys across the country. =>NEGATIVE
I have been a Best Buy customer for over 20 years. On July 28, 2017, my husband and I went into your store to purchase a computer for our son, who attends on-line school. We selected an HP Omen laptop priced at $1099.99 and a 2 year protection plan for $279.99. =>NEGATIVE

Hi. If I buy a washer/dryer with in-home delivery, will Best Buy remove my old units FROM THE BASEMENT or do I already need to have them out of the basement and waiting on the curb for them to do that? I don't think I can get these out of the basement on my own. =>NEGATIVE

Poor customer service will kill a business. They weren't terrible, they simply weren't good enough to justify spending close to 90 mins to get an iPad. Next time, I'll one-click it on Amazon and get it the next business day. In retrospect, I should have done this today. My bad. =>NEGATIVE
