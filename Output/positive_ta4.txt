The best thing to come out of the holocaust is jokes about the holocaust. Maybe people do find the holocaust shocking, but use humour to supress it. Not everyone is you, you know. =>POSITIVE

>bigot: a person who is intolerant towards those holding different opinions How are blacks, women, Jews, etc, different opinions? Even if the game wasn't inclusive," I'd still be fine with it. What's wrong with making fun of blacks, gays, etc, if you don't genuinely mean it?" =>POSITIVE
Did you open it without paying for it? =>POSITIVE
I don't think this is anti-semetic. Unless Target were to refuse to sell similar items making fun of whites, blacks, whatever, then it's completely fine. This isn't actual discrimination. These are simply jokes. I can get not finding the jokes funny, but they're not anti-semetic. =>POSITIVE
This game came out while Obama was president though. And he’s not Jewish. =>POSITIVE
and some of those groups suffer more prejudice and violence in the real world than others, and as such a game that targets them with ridicule or humor that furthers that violence deserves criticism =>POSITIVE

My in-laws are Holocaust survivors, they lost their entire family. Nothing fucking funny about this 'game' which would make any neo-Nazi happy. Would a game making lite of slavery/Jim Crow be funny? Or are Jews a legit target? Pun intended. =>POSITIVE
Maybe in these days of increasing racism and antisemitism perhaps the makers of this game ought to stop making profits over human prejudice? There is a limit, or should be. But I guess in today's world there are no limits. Learn from history or relive it. =>POSITIVE

Surprising how this occurs after they purchased land on the boarder to block Trumps Wall =>POSITIVE
1. So what 2. Is not the only Cards targeting a religious /ethnic group 3. They are always adding more 4. Then don't buy the game Target, you are not forcing ppl to buy the cards. This is America. Sell the cards. Give ppl their freedom of choice. =>POSITIVE
Okay ... listen lady get this through your brain. 1) it isn’t the “racist leaders” fault Target was selling cards against humanity 2) the writers of the game are JEWISH 3) taking your business does nothing to a multi billion dollar company =>POSITIVE
Matt and Trey have made fun of Islam on so many occasions what are you talking about =>POSITIVE

So not a fan of any Jewish comedian? Mel Brooks? =>POSITIVE
If you don’t find dark humor funny why the fuck did you buy the game =>POSITIVE
Nobody cares what you don't find humorous, idiot. =>POSITIVE
I personally haven't, but if true, point conceded. As long as it's somewhat consistent...ridicule, satire and offense are important parts of freedom of expression. =>POSITIVE
Yaaasss!!! it’s absolutely amazing! 30-50% and then 20% with the app and another 5% with a Red Card!! I’m obsessed with that app!! =>POSITIVE

Ah but he can't get Twitter famous if he doesn't go out of his way to be offended =>POSITIVE
You could replace Jewish" with any of those words and it'll still be hilarious. I actually have the "Jew Pack" among others and they're funny. People are too sensitive " =>POSITIVE
So like, did you purchase that, thereby supporting these anti semetic" jokes, or did you just open it without purchasing it like a degenerate." =>POSITIVE

1. Humor is subjective. 2. Your sense of humor isn't the rule of the land. 3. Stop. =>POSITIVE
This is America. We are all free to do what we like in our own homes. We are all free to think whatever we want. What I find disturbing and just sad, is that so many defend degrading and cruel *humor*, as if being nasty is something to be admired. Again...wow. =>POSITIVE
Do you love as much as I do Wendi? =>POSITIVE
You must be fun at parties... =>POSITIVE
Nice! Haven’t seen that one before! =>POSITIVE

I don't find this funny, how dare they put this here!"" =>POSITIVE
Please explain to me how finding this game in this store and others has drastically altered your life in a negative way. Did it kill someone you love? Did it cost you your job or home? Did it cause a break up with your S.O.? Did it give you a terminal illness? =>POSITIVE
1. Then don't buy them, it's that simple. If you're going to be a big crybaby about it go do it in your safe space. 2. The people who created CaH are literally Jewish, and thus they probably felt most comfortable with humor that targeted the group they're a part of. =>POSITIVE
I'm jewish. Fuck this asshole and the fuckheads getting offended on my behalf. This shit's hilarious. =>POSITIVE
Are you still in Kansas =>POSITIVE
